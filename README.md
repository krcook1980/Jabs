## How to use the repository
Each time you come to work
1) make sure you are in the main branch in terminal (gitbash or in vs Code open a new terminal)
2) git pull (this gets all of the most recent files and work done by the team)

Now before you change any file - make a working branch
1) in the terminal type git checkout -b "nameMyBranch"
    pick something meaningful so we can find it later if needed
2) make sure you are in that branch (it says branch name at end of terminal)



Great - do your work. You can push to github to your branch as a save feature:

1) in the terminal type git add .
2) git commit -m "add a meaningful comment"
3) git push

The first time you push your branch it will have you do one more thing:
1) Copy and paste this line git push --set-upstream origin pushAndPull
2) then git push


When you are finished working on that feature or branch ... MAKE SURE YOU ADD THE PULL REQUEST TO GET IT IN THERE FOR THE REST OF US!
Do the prior step to push the most recent work and then:

1) in the code you just received back is a link to create a pull request, click that link
    IF that link is missing or whatever, go into github to the repository and you can create the pull request there
2) The top should be Base:Main and the Compare: should be your branch name
3) Enter any comment you think, request a specific reviewer if you want
4) Click the Create Pull Request

In github someone will approve your pull request change and merge it to the main. IF we run into any conflicts DON'T PANIC! We can resolve them together.

DON'T FORGET:
If the above completed a project task:
1) In github, go into the project tab
2) Click the project name
3) find the task in the in progress list (ideally it is there because you moved it there... it might be in todo?)
4) move the task to the done list
5) click the task name and scroll down to check it off as done
6) Someone else can move it to the really really done list when we agree the objective is met
