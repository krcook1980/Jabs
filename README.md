  ## Description
   This versatile and scalable survey tool utilizes mysql, sequelize, handlebars, plotly, passport, html, css, and javascript in order to collect data and store it for graphing of statitics.   
   
   We chose to create a survey to help track the side effects of the Covid-19 Vaccine. By collecting demographic information, we can allow the user to view commonly experienced symptoms by race, age group, or sex. We also built an administrator access area in order to view and maintain records. This application is seeded if data, and deployed on Heroku.
